YelpCamp is small project which I created for my learning purpose. It's created with node.js, express, and mongodb.

# What is YelpCamp?
YelpCamp is a website where you can check out beautiful camping sites uploaded by other users. YelpCamp provides location and images for each site. You can create an account and review other camping sites or you can list out your own camping site for others. You can edit your own campgrounds any time you want.
